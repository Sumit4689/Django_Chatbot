## What is RAG?

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a technique that combines:
- Information retrieval from a knowledge base
- Language model generation capabilities

## How it works

1. Documents are loaded and split into chunks
2. Chunks are converted to embeddings and stored in a vector database
3. When you ask a question, relevant chunks are retrieved
4. The LLM uses these chunks to generate an accurate answer

## Example Topics

You can add your own documents to the data folder:
- Company policies
- Product documentation
- Technical guides
- FAQ documents
- Research papers

## File Formats Supported

- Text files (.txt)
- PDF files (.pdf)

Add your documents to this folder and run the ingest script to update the knowledge base!
